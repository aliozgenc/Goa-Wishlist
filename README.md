# Goa-Wishlist
I never really understand why we have to register for adding products to our wishlist. 
Anyways, here is my solution: 
A custom wishlist plugin that lets you add wishlist items to your wishlist page without needing a registration process for WooCommerce. 

Specs:
- You don't need to register to add some products to your wishlist.
- Saves your wishlist page for 30 days.
- Remembers which products are added on wishlist on Shop page.

In the future I'm planning to make these changes:
- More admin page abilities for a better control for your needs.
- Add a share button so a visitor/user can share their wishlist to others through social media.
- Will change some CSS for styling.
- Make a proper file structure so the plugin will be more readable for developers.
- Plugin will be able to remember for your wishlist forever (or till you delete them, lol) as soon as you become a registered customer.

<b>Install:</b>
Simply put in /plugins directory and unzip. <br>
Requires WooCommerce.

If you have other suggestions please let me know.

Thank you,
